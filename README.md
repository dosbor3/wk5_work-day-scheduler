# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

The work day scheduler allows an employee to add important events to a daily planner to manage time effectively.  The schduler will allow the user to create
a schedule when the work day scheduler application is opened.  The current date will be displayed at the top of the calender when the application is opened.  
The user will have the ability to scroll down and be presetned with time blocks for standard business hours.  When the user view the time blocks for a particular
date, the dates will be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.  The user will be able to click into a time block and enter/edit an event, clicking save to store the event to local storage.  The application allows the user to end the current web session, and return viewing their saved events
